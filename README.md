# Bike_stores_Analysis
#The SQL database contains selling bicycle data that includes 321 bicycle products across 9 brands  and 7 categories. 
Time runs from 2016 January 1 to 2018 December 28. 
First, I started by preparing  the database schema beforehand, as shown in BIKESTORE MODEL file . The table shows the connection between the nine tables. It is based on a relational database management system (RDBMS).There are ten tables. These table names are; product.brand, product.category, product.stock, sale.customer, sale.order_item, sale.orders, sale.staff, sale.store , sales.Details.
